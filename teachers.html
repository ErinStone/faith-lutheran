               <p>My name is William Serbeniuk but understandably the kids call me Mr. Billy. I have been teaching preschool for 8 years. I enjoy challenging children in ways that keep them learning and having fun! We explore the world through show-and-tell, story time, art, music, physical activity, gardening, and more! Everyday is different and I learn as much from my kids as they do from me. Students in my class can expect to learn sign-language and Spanish!</p>

               <h2>Kindergarten/1st Grade: Mrs. Gremel</h2> 
               <p>Hi! My name is Darla Gremel. I have been teaching for 33 years and am still as excited about teaching as I was my first year in the classroom. God is good and has given me the opportunity to minister to hundreds of children. Most of my experience has been in grades 1 and 2.  Recently I am teaching Kindergarten. I can not tell you how blessed I am to get to work with some of our youngest students. My experience in 1st and 2nd grade have given me extra insight when it comes to the academic achievements expected of kindergarten students. "Jesus Time" (religion) is my favorite time in the day. Watching students grow spiritually brings such joy to my life. Other than teaching, I enjoy music, time with my grand-baby, and early morning devotions with God. </p>

               <p>Hi! My name is Cathy Summerset. I have been teaching for 28 years and am thrilled to be a part of the "Faith Family." I enjoy being in a community that focuses on Christ as we pursue academic excellence. I value parent-teacher relationships and see them as key to the success of my students. I desire to pair with parents to meet the needs of each of my students. When I have time I like to go to the movies, do puzzles, window shop, and go out to eat.</p>

               <p>I am Mary Hart and I love to help children discover a love for reading! I came to Faith at the beginning of the 2013/2014 school year and I am so at home here! I laugh when I tell people that I had never imagined an upstairs library before but you know what? It works! We have over 10,000 library books and I still can't help but buy new ones every week! Putting books in the hands of children is thrilling! Of course my major hobby is READING but I also love to paper craft, go to musicals and concerts, cruise the world, and enjoy time with friends and family. Breakfast out is at the top of my list too! </p>
