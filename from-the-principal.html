      <h2>An Open Letter To All</h2>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit Faith Lutheran School's website. I am so pleased to be part of such an amazing community of people who who are committed to our students and their families. I can attest first hand to the love that each of our staff, church members, supporters, and volunteers have for the children in our school. It is a day and age where the choice you make for your child's education can play a huge role in the character they display now as children and later as adults. We strive for excellence in education and evaluate our practices, curriculum, and approaches often. However, one thing has remained the same at Faith for the last 62 years - we teach children about Jesus and the great love he has for our students. He laid down his life for the sake of redeeming us and therefore we can have a personal relationship with Him. </p>
      <p>At Faith, all of our teachers are dedicated to ministering to children daily. Regardless of background, ability, behavior, ethnicity, or any other factor, we love the children in our school and pray that God work through us to teach and lead your children. Students at Faith sing in church quarterly,  participate in chapel weekly, have religion daily, are prayed for hourly, and loved every minute. </p>
      <p>In the last year Faith has grown significantly! Sometimes change is hard but our Faith Family has embraced the new while protecting our core values and teachings. I invite you to come and visit us to see what is a "buzz" at Faith! We now have an extensive library, an improved playground, and upgraded technology. With support from Lutheran Churches around town we are making a difference in our community. Won't you join us in our mission to bring up Christian leaders in the next generation? Thank you for considering Faith for you precious little ones!</p>
      <p>God's blessings on you and your family,<br>
  Esther Nicholas</p>
